# Authentication System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The TeslaStarter authentication system provides secure user authentication, authorization, and Tesla account integration using Descope as the primary identity provider. This document outlines the requirements, user flows, and technical implementation details for the authentication features.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Provide secure, frictionless user authentication
2. Enable Tesla account linking via OAuth 2.0
3. Automatically synchronize user profiles between Descope and local database
4. Protect API endpoints and frontend routes from unauthorized access

### Success Metrics
- User registration completion rate > 90%
- Authentication success rate > 99%
- Tesla account linking success rate > 95%
- Zero authentication-related security incidents

## User Stories

### Authentication
1. **As a new user**, I want to sign up with my email so that I can create a TeslaStarter account
2. **As a returning user**, I want to log in quickly so that I can access my dashboard
3. **As a user**, I want to stay logged in across sessions so that I don't have to authenticate repeatedly
4. **As a user**, I want to securely log out so that others cannot access my account

### Tesla Integration
5. **As a user**, I want to link my Tesla account so that TeslaStarter can access my vehicle data
6. **As a user**, I want to unlink my Tesla account if I no longer want to share data
7. **As a user**, I want my Tesla tokens to refresh automatically so I maintain continuous access

### Profile Management
8. **As a user**, I want to view my profile information so I can verify my account details
9. **As an admin**, I want to see all registered users to understand platform usage

## Functional Requirements

### User Registration Flow
1. User clicks "Sign Up" on the login page
2. Descope sign-up flow is presented (email/password or social login)
3. User completes Descope authentication
4. Backend automatically creates user record in database
5. User is redirected to dashboard

### User Login Flow
1. User clicks "Sign In" on the login page
2. Descope sign-in flow is presented
3. User enters credentials
4. Upon successful authentication:
   - Session token is stored in browser
   - User profile is synchronized with database
   - User is redirected to originally requested page or dashboard

### Tesla Account Linking Flow
1. User clicks "Link Tesla Account" on dashboard
2. System generates OAuth state and PKCE challenge
3. User is redirected to Tesla's OAuth authorization page
4. User authorizes TeslaStarter access
5. Tesla redirects back with authorization code
6. System exchanges code for access/refresh tokens
7. Tokens are securely stored with user account
8. User sees "Tesla Account Connected" status

### Protected Route Access
1. User attempts to access protected route
2. System checks for valid session token
3. If valid: Allow access
4. If invalid/missing: Redirect to login with return URL

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Requirements

#### Authentication Endpoints
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
- `GET /api/auth/users` - List all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/auth/tesla/authorize` - Initialize Tesla OAuth flow
- `POST /api/auth/tesla/callback` - Complete Tesla OAuth flow
- `POST /api/auth/tesla/refresh` - Refresh Tesla tokens
- `DELETE /api/auth/tesla/unlink` - Remove Tesla account link

#### Security Requirements
- All endpoints require HTTPS in production
- Bearer token authentication for API access
- Token validation on every request
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- CORS configuration for allowed origins

#### Data Storage
- User profiles stored in PostgreSQL
- Tesla refresh tokens encrypted at rest
- Session tokens managed by Descope
- OAuth state stored temporarily in memory cache

### Frontend Requirements

#### Components
1. **Login Page** - Descope authentication flow
2. **Protected Route** - Wrapper for authenticated content
3. **User Profile Card** - Display user information
4. **Tesla Link Button** - Initiate OAuth flow
5. **User List Table** - Display all users (admin view)

#### State Management
- Authentication state in React Context
- User data cached with React Query
- Automatic token refresh in API client
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Login page load time < 2 seconds
- Authentication completion < 3 seconds
- API response time < 200ms for auth checks
- Frontend route transitions < 100ms

### Security
- No sensitive data in localStorage
- Tokens transmitted only over HTTPS
- XSS protection via React
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime for authentication service
- Graceful degradation if Descope is unavailable
- Automatic retry for failed token refreshes
- Clear error messages for users

### Scalability
- Support 10,000 concurrent users
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Caching strategy for user profiles
- Efficient database queries with indexes

## User Interface Requirements

### Design Principles
- Clean, modern interface using ShadCN UI
- Consistent with Tesla's design language
- Mobile-responsive layouts
- Accessible to users with disabilities

### Key Screens

#### Login Screen
- Centered card with TeslaStarter branding
- Descope authentication component
- "Remember me" functionality
- Password reset option

#### Dashboard
- User profile section with:
  - Email address
  - Display name
  - Tesla account status
  - Member since date
- Tesla account management:
  - Link/unlink buttons
  - Token refresh option
  - Connection status indicator
- User directory table (if authorized)

#### Error States
- Clear error messages for:
  - Invalid credentials
  - Network errors
  - Tesla linking failures
  - Expired sessions

## Implementation Phases

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Descope Service Outage
- **Impact**: Users cannot authenticate
- **Mitigation**: Implement fallback authentication method

### Risk: Tesla API Changes
- **Impact**: OAuth flow breaks
- **Mitigation**: Monitor Tesla developer updates, implement versioning

### Risk: Token Theft
- **Impact**: Unauthorized vehicle access
- **Mitigation**: Token encryption, short expiration times, refresh rotation

### Risk: User Data Breach
- **Impact**: Privacy violation, regulatory issues
- **Mitigation**: Encryption at rest, minimal data collection, regular audits

## Success Criteria

1. Zero authentication-related security incidents in first 6 months
2. User satisfaction rating > 4.5/5 for auth experience
3. < 1% authentication failure rate
4. 100% of Tesla tokens successfully refresh when needed
5. Complete audit trail for all authentication events
